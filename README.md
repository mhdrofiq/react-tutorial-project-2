# React tutorial project 1 results

This is the result of completing an assignment from a tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org on youtube. [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=12s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

This is a static webpage made using ReactJs. The purpose of this was to apply what was learnt from project 1 of the tutorial and use it to build something similar from scratch.

A preview of the page is shown below.
